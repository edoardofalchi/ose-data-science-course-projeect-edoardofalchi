# OSE data science final project | Edoardo Falchi | Summersemester 2021

**Card, David, and Alan Krueger. (1994)** [“Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.”](https://www.nber.org/papers/w4509) American Economic Review 84: 772–93.

David Card and Alan B. Krueger reported evidence that called into question the conventional view of the labor-market effects of minimum-wage laws. In particular, they surveyed fast-food establishments in New Jersey and Pennsylvania in 1992 before and after the minimum wage in New Jersey rose from $4.25 to $5.05. By comparing the changes in employment in these two states, they constructed a simple “difference-in-differences” test of the prediction that minimum-wage increases reduce employment of affected workers. Contrary to this prediction, they find “no evidence that the rise in New Jersey’s minimum wage reduced employment at fast-food restaurants in the state ...” and in fact that “the increase in the minimum wage increased employment”.

## Structure of notebook

A typical project notebook has the following structure:

* presentation of baseline article with proper citation and brief summary

* using causal graphs to illustrate the authors' identification strategy

* replication of selected key results

* critical assessment of quality

* independent contribution, e.g. additional external evidence, robustness checks, visualization

There might be good reason to deviate from this structure. If so, please simply document your reasoning and go ahead. Please use the opportunity to review other student projects for some inspirations as well.
